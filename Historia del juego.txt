In the heart of Barcelona, the majestic Sagrada Familia stands as an eternal testament to the vision of Antonio Gaudí. However, as the sun sets behind its towers, an ancient secret begins to awaken. The architect's masterpiece is not only a symbol of faith and creativity but also a labyrinth of thoughts and emotions trapped in time.
One day, a crucial piece disappears from Gaudí's workshop: an artifact that holds the harmony of his work. Without it, the Sagrada Familia risks collapsing into chaos of forms and colors. Echoes of the past resonate within the walls of the labyrinth, and Gaudí's thoughts and demons come to life, each with their own powers and desires.
